# skai_labs_tasks

This repository was created with the purpose of solving tasks given by the company SKAI LABS to assess my skills. 
It contains three files, each representing one of the tasks.
In each file, there is a task description text and its solution.

Task 1
  To run this program via the terminal, follow these steps:
  Open the terminal on your computer.
  Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your index.html and main.js files are located.
  Start a local web server from the terminal. If you have Python installed, you can use a simple HTTP server with this command:
    python -m http.server
  This command starts an HTTP server on your local machine. It will open the local server at the address http://localhost:8000/.
  Now, open a web browser and type the address http://localhost:8000/index.html to see the program's output.

Task 2
  To run this Flask program through the terminal, follow these steps:
  Open the terminal.
  Navigate to the directory where your app.py file is located using the cd command.
  If you haven't already, install the Flask framework using pip. You can do this with the following command:
    pip install Flask
  Once Flask is installed, you can run your program using the Python command:
    python app.py
  After the program starts, you will see a message in the terminal indicating that the Flask application is running. It usually looks like this:
   * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
  Now you can open a web browser and enter the address http://127.0.0.1:5000/unauthorized-sales to send a POST request with JSON data to your Flask route /unauthorized-sales and see the response.

Task 3
  To run this Flask program through the terminal, follow these steps:
  Open the terminal.
  Navigate to the directory where your task3.py file is located using the cd command.
  If you haven't already, install the Flask framework using pip. You can do this with the following command:
    pip install Flask
  Once Flask is installed, you can run your program using the Python command:
    python app.py
  After the program starts, you will see a message in the terminal indicating that the Flask application is running. It usually looks like this:
   * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
  Now you can open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/interview_scheduling to access the route defined in your Flask application and see the response.
